Features - 

 The application displays an interactive map interface, allowing users to explore different geographical locations.
 Users can search for specific locations, addresses, or landmarks, and the map will navigate to the corresponding location.

 The application provides the ability to plan routes between different locations, including options for driving, walking, or public transportation.

Technologies Used - 

 HTML/CSS: Used for structuring and styling the user interface.
JavaScript: The core functionality of the application is implemented using JavaScript, including map rendering, search functionality, and interaction handling.
Map API: Leveraged a map API (Mapbox) for displaying and interacting with the map.
